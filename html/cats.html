                    Welcome to our feline-friendly community! Here, you'll find everything you need to keep your cat
                    healthy and happy.
                    Whether you're a new cat owner or a seasoned pro, we're here to provide valuable insights and tips
                    for your beloved pet.
                    <br><br>
                    Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are currently the
                    second most popular domestic pet in the United States. While there are over 60 unique documented
                    cat breeds, care and diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and practices
                    are generally recommended for the well-being of your fluffy family member regardless of breed.

                        It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is either pregnant or
                        nursing)
                        directly nurse her young if possible. Monitor your kitten&apos;s growth closely to make sure its
                        growth
                        rate is progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker
                        might
                        need to feed the kitten directly either with a bottle or a feeding tube.
                        Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight appropriately include the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk</li>
                        <li>Gastrointestinal disease</li>
                        <li>Environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions</li>
                    </ul>

                        Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically around three to four weeks
                        after birth. According to the ASPCA, kittens at this age should eat half to one cup of dry
                        kitten
                        food or six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has difficulties eating
                        hard
                        food, a small amount of water can be added to soften the food.

                        Cat food that is optimized for kittens provides the additional nutrients that are needed for
                        growth,
                        energy, and wellness. Depending on the breed, your cat may have different dietary requirements.
                        You should always consult with your veterinarian for recommendations.

                        This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many nutrients. At this age,
                        their level
                        of activity decreases, and so does their metabolism. It is <strong>not</strong> recommended to
                        leave food out for the cats all day.
                        Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals rather than snacking throughout the
                        day.
                        This practice reduces the risk of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.

                        Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and experience a lot of changes.
                        Cats at this age should eat less fats and calories and more quality proteins. This means when
                        you are purchasing packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular protein
                        (such as "salmon")
                        and not just a category (such as fish). This usually means they are byproducts, or combinations,
                        of lesser quality proteins.
