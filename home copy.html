                    Pets are nature's gift to humanity. It has been scientifically proven that opening our homes 
                    and hearts to a pet increases our longevity and improves our overall quality of life as well 
                    as the lives of our pets. At Pet Paradigm Professionals, our mission is to offer resources to 
                    help you care for your furry, scaly, feathery, and slimy loved ones. Our pet experts—or 
                    “Pexperts”—have been working with pet owners and professionals alike for the past twelve years. 
                    They offer one-on-one consultations with current and prospective pet owners as well as group 
                    presentations designed for veterinary, pet shelter, and pet breeding professionals.
